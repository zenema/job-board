It is because of our machines that the world\u2019s technology has steadily evolved.</p>\n<p>Metrology software orchestrates the behavior of powerful mechatronic modules, so that together they achieve an extraordinary combination of speed and accuracy. For example, one such module, the wafer stage, accelerates faster than a fighter jet to enable the ASML machine to position a silicon wafer with nanometer accuracy in less than one second! ASML also uses metrology systems to measure and compensate for sub-nanometer inaccuracies that inevitably appear due to material imperfections, temperature fluctuations, or atmospheric pressure changes. Only the most advanced metrology systems ever imagined can do the job.</p>\n<h2>Job Description</h2>\n<p>We are looking for metrology software designers.
